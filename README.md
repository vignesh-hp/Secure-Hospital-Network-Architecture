# Secure-Hospital-Network-Architecture
Enterprise-level secure hospital network design with VLAN segmentation, routing, and healthcare compliance controls.
# 🏥 Secure Hospital Network Architecture

## 📌 Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a scalable, secure, and high-availability hospital network infrastructure supporting critical healthcare environments, including the ICU, OPD (Outpatient Department), Wards, Administration, IT Hub, and Reception.

The architecture follows a hierarchical core–distribution–access model to ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and optimized traffic flow. Special emphasis was placed on protecting sensitive patient health information (PHI), ensuring regulatory compliance, and minimizing operational downtime in life-critical environments.

The design integrates logical segmentation, routing optimization, secure authentication mechanisms, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies to maintain performance and security across departments.

This project focuses on:
- VLAN segmentation
- Subnet isolation
- AAA implementation
- Dynamic routing (OSPF/EIGRP)
- QoS prioritization
- Healthcare compliance considerations

🔐 Security Features
- Department-based VLAN segmentation
- Isolated ICU subnet
- Guest WiFi segregation
- AAA authentication server
- High availability routing design
- Redundancy planning

🛠 Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN & Subnetting
- Dynamic Routing Protocols
- QoS Implementation
- HTTP / SMTP / AAA Servers

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
- Network segmentation for lateral movement prevention
- Secure routing architecture
- Healthcare compliance considerations
- High-availability infrastructure planning
