- Isolated ICU subnet
- Guest WiFi segregation
- AAA authentication server
- High availability routing design
- Redundancy planning

🛠 Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN & Subnetting
- Dynamic Routing Protocols
- QoS Implementation
- HTTP / SMTP / AAA Servers

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
- Network segmentation for lateral movement prevention
- Secure routing architecture
- Healthcare compliance considerations
- High-availability infrastructure planning
